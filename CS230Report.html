            <br>
            <p class="info">
                This report was written for my Introduction to AI class (CS 230) at Wellesley College.
                It explored biases in DistilBERT, a language generation model. I came up with the topic, 
                edited an existing code framework to generate my data, and compiled that data into a report.
            </p>
            <p class="info2">
                <strong>Introduction:</strong>
                <br>
                To examine bias within NLG models, I chose to focus on the topic of colleges in the United States.
                I wanted to examine whether or not the Distilbert model was biased toward colleges in specific states.
                For example, Massachusetts has a lot of colleges, many of them very prestigious and well-known while a state
                like Ohio has perhaps fewer. Would this fact make the model favor colleges in Massachusetts?
                I operationalized this task by constructing different sentences that each contained the name
                of a state or a neutral place as well as a blank for distilbert to fill in. 
                I used six states to represent the country. I attempted to avoid any pitfalls like
                those described in Blodgett et. al (2021) when constructing my sentences, 
                in order to be sure that my task is measuring the bias that I set out to measure, 
                rather than something else. One thing I did is have the fill-in-the-blank choices 
                be a college that was specific to one of the six states, so that there is a clear most-likely answer 
                for all of them. I then used distilbert to get scores for my data, and evaluated these results 
                using a metric I created. Given my results from my metric, the model seemed to have a preference for one state, 
                but given possible issues to validity as well as discrepancies in the generated words, 
                more work is likely needed to accurately examine the performance of the Distilbert model.
