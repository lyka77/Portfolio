                <br>
                <strong>Class:</strong> CS220 Human-Computer Interaction
                <br>
                <br>
                The idea behind this project was to go through the 5 stages of UX design for an app 
                that would cultivate gratitude within the Wellesley community. 
                We chose to do this by creating a platform where people 
                could save and share photographs, messages, and voice recordings from around campus, 
                and connect to others in the community.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Initial Wireframe:</h3>
            <div class="row justify-content-center">
                <img src="unnamed copy.jpg" alt="" style="width: 40%;">
                <img src="unnamed.jpg" alt="" style="width: 40%;">
            </div>
            <p class="info2">
                <br>
                To begin, we sketched out a wireframe to display the overall function of our app and communicate 
                our ideas. The wireframes were then presented to our classmates and they had the opportunity to 
                give us feedback on them.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Low-fidelity Prototype:</h3>
            <div class="row justify-content-center">
                <img src="Figma proto2.png" alt="" class="infoImgs">
                <img src="Figma proto1.png" alt="" class="infoImgs">
                <img src="Figmaproto3.png" alt="" class="infoImgs">
            </div>
            <p class="info2">
                
                <br>
                Using the feedback we recieved from our wireframe, we used figma to create a low-fidelity 
                prototype of all the different screens and interactions between them. The above pictures show
                some of these screens, displaying the home screen, the account profile, and the messaging and
                posting functions. 
            </p>
            <h3>High-fidelity Prototype:</h3>
            <p class="info2">
                
                Then, using the feedback we recieved from the low-fidelity prototype, we used figma to create a high-fidelity
                prototype, which would be our final version of this project. This step really was about refining our design, 
                color scheme, and some aspects of how users would interact with our interface, like how many clicks
                it would take for someone to get from a message back to the home page, how intuitive the posting was,
                and how users could move around the map.

            <h3>Demo video:</h3>
            <p class="info2">
                While our final product didn't include every detail and feature that an actual coded
                version of the app would have, we achieved our goal of creating a high-fidelity mock up of
                the general behavior and design of such an app.

            <h3> Main Takeaway:</h3>
            <p class="info2">
                Through this project I learned a lot about what goes into every stage of design. 
                I also gained many technical skills within figma, such as how to make a scrollable
                background or make it seem like your clicks are actually doing something to make the 
                experience of clicking through the prototype more realistic. This project also 
                helped me develop my teamwork skills further, as working with five peopleon one project 
                came with some challenges like finding time to meet, working through creative 
                disagreements, and relying on everyone to do their part equally and on time.
