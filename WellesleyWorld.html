            <br>
            <p class="info"> <strong>Team Members:</strong> Eleanor Braun, Chelsea Ji, Jada Onwuta
                <br>
                <strong>Class:</strong> CS304 Databases with Web Interfaces
                <br>
                <br>
                This project was pretty open ended, we just had to come up with an idea 
                for a website that we would then design, implement, and test. Our idea was to 
                create a page where wellesley students and alumni could connect based on 
                interest, location, and career aspirations in a casual and simple way.
                We used the tools we learned in this class such as html, css, javascript, 
                EJS, and mongoDB to implement our site. 
            </p>
            <p class="info2">
                The stages to the development of our website were:
                <ul>
                    <li>Proposal</li>
                    <li>Design & Implementation Plan</li>
                    <li>Draft Version</li>
                    <li>Alpha Version</li>
                    <li>Beta Version</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="info2">
                After each stage, we got feedback from our professor and sometimes our peers
                that we applied in the next stage. The proposal and design parts of this project
                were tackled as a team, but once we moved on to implementation we divided
                the work of development up between the four of us, meeting occasionally and 
                communicating to make sure it was cohesive. The parts I tackled were mainly
                the chat function/page and several design aspects like the look of the login and 
                launchpage. I also tackled friending/unfriending, designed the logo, and 
                worked alongside my teammates on some other aspects.

            <br>
            <p class="info">
                Through this project I learned about the process of designing and implenting
                a website from start to finish. Although I had previously worked with 
                html and css, and at least a little javascript, this project really helped hone 
                my skills and introduced me to new ones. I was proud of what I was able to 
                accomplish in a fairly short period of time. This project also taught me
                a lot about how to work with a team effectively.
