                <br>
                This app was created as a final project for the class CS 317: Mobile App Development,
                under Professor Franklyn Turbak. My partner and I worked on several phases of this 
                project, from the initial pitch all the way to a final version. 
            </p>
            <p class="info2">
                In the class CS 317: Mobile app development we were tasked with coming up with an idea
                for an app that we would then create using react native. My partner and I 
                decided to create an app similar to Yelp and Beli that would take users
                dietary, monetary, distance, and cuisine preferences and give them a feed of
                restaurants near them that fit their tastes. To set our project apart from
                already existing apps, we also added a feature similar to Spotify's "blend",
                where users could create groups with their friends and get 
                reccomended restaurants based on the preferences of the whole group. 
                We used react native as the framework for our app, and Firebase to store our data. 
                We also used Yelp's publicly available dataset as our restaurant data.
                Ultimately our app focused more on function than design, as we had a lot
                to get done in a comparatively short time. Due to this, our design was very
                bare bones, and does not reflect what we'd necessarily have liked a publishable
                version of this app to look like.
            </p>

            </div>
            <br>
            <div class= "caption" style="width: 100%;">
                Here are the sign up and login pages, as well as the profile page 
                that the profile tab show, and the account settings and preferences.
                The most important part to explain is the preferences tab, where users
                would set their fairly static preferences. For example, if a user is 
                vegetarian and only wants to see vegetarian restaurants, but 
                doesn't want to specify this every time they are looking, they would set
                that preference here. 
                We will look at the setup of the individual categories more in the 
                filtering section below. 
            </div>

            <br>
            <div class= "caption" style="width: 60%;">
                The first image shows the home page, a feed of restaurants based on
                the settings that have been set in the profile page. clicking on a
                restaurant will take a user to the page with some more details about
                it including its proximity  and location on a map.

            <h3>Sorting & Filtering:</h3>
            <div class="row justify-content-start" >
                <img src="TastebudsPics/IMG_9157.PNG" alt="" style="width: 16.66%;">

            <div class= "caption" style="width: 100%;">
                The sorting and filtering is accessed by pressing the blue 
                button in the top corner of the homepage. This feature is 
                similar to the preferences in the home page, but is meant
                as temporary filtering or sorting, such as when a user is
                trying to look for, for example, the cheapest Thai 
                restaurant nearby. Users can sort and/or filter by price, 
                distance, average rating, and cuisine type. The list of
                cuisines is quite comprehensive, and in alphabetical order.

            <div class= "caption"style="width: 80%;">
                These pictures represent the groups homepage, where a user can 
                accept or reject invitations to groups, and access information
                about the groups they belong to, such as the current
                or pending members. They can also add members and 
                access the restaurant feed for that group. The idea behind groups 
                was to generate reccomendations based on the needs of several
                different people easily. The restaurant recs for a group 
                take into account the preferences of each member, and then can be 
                sorted or filtered from there.

                These photos show in more depth how to create new groups and add 
                people. In order to invite someone, you must know their email.
                You can add members as part of the process of creating a group,
                and go back and add people later as well. Once an invite is 
                sent it shows up on the other persons groups page as seen above,
                 and they can choose to accept or reject.

            <h3>Main Takeaway:</h3>
            <p class="info2">
                This project was one of the more difficult ones I have encountered in my
                time at Wellesley because of the scope, the time limit, and the learning
                curve of interacting with some completely new concepts and tools such as node JS and
                firebase. In this process, we often had to re-evaluate what features were 
                necessary to our app and which ones we felt we could cut out, or implement
                only if we had extra time. One challenge we faced was having to prove to our
                professor that the "groups" idea was worth the time and effort, becuase 
                while he cautioned us to rethink it, the feedback we had gotten from our peers
                was that it was the feature that was most interesting to them.
                <br>
                <br>
                    My biggest regret with this project is that we didn't have more time
                to put towards design and aesthetics. I am an artist at heart and I always 
                like to be able to delve into the more creative aspects of development. I 
                would have liked to be able to come up with a more cohesive and attractive 
                color palette, and design a logo as well.
                <br>
                <br>
                    Working in a partnership also presented unique challenges because
                most of the time we were working individually on different parts of the 
                project, and things weren't always communicated effectively. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    However, problems that challenge me ultimately make me a better coder, and the 
                final project, while not perfect, was a strong reflection of all the hours of work 
                that were put into it.
